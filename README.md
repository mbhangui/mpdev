# mpdev

**mpdev** is a music player daemon event watcher. It connects to the mpd socket and uses mpd's idle command to listen for player events. Whenever an event occurs, mpdev can carry out various activities using user defined hooks. The idea for doing mpdev comes from [mpdcron](https://alip.github.io/mpdcron/). The need for doing this project came from the necessity of maintaining play counts and history for [RompR](https://fatg3erman.github.io/RompR/) music player. It is a good player but you can't be running it when you are especially using a headless devices running mpd, like the Raspberry PI, Sparky and others. You could just be powering on these device, select a playlist using an application on your linux/OSX desktop (mpc, ncmpc, ncmpcpp, GMPC, Sonata, Cantata), android (MPDroid, MPD control), IOS (MPoD, MPaD) and browser based (RompR, O!MPD, ympd). Once you have chosen your playlist, you could come out of your application. When you come out any of these applications maintaining of history and play counts will stop. As a workaraound, you can enable scrobbling to submit your songs to last.fm, libre.fm. But what if you don't want to submit your songs outside? What if you want to have your listening habits with you in your own database? In such case you can run mpdev and maintain your own database to capture your listening habits.

mpdev helps in bulding a database of your played tracks. Along with a script `mpdplaylist`, it can generate a playlist for mpd as per your taste and mood.

You can create scripts in $HOME/.mpdev directory. The default installation installs a script named $HOME/.mpdev/player for the uid 1000. The script does the following

1. scrobbles titles to last.fm and libre.fm. You have to create API keys by running lastfm-scrobbler and librefm-scrobbler one time
2. updates play counts in the sqlite stats.db and [RompR](https://fatg3erman.github.io/RompR/) db
3. Synchronizes the ratings in the sticker (sqlite), [RompR](https://fatg3erman.github.io/RompR/) (MySQL) and the stats (sqlite) databases. It also initializes the rating to 3 when you play an unrated song.

The above three are actually done by running a hook, a script named `player` in $HOME/.mpdev directory. You can put your own script named `player` in this directory. In fact mpdev can run specific hooks for specific types of mpd events. A hook can be any executable program or script. It will be passed arguments and have certain environment variables related to the song playing, available to it. Below is a list of of events and corresping hooks that will be executed if available.

MPD EVENT|Hook script
---------|-----------
SONG_CHANGE|~/.mpdev/player
STICKER_EVENT|~/.mpdev/sticker
MIXER_EVENT|~/.mpdev/mixer
OPTIONS_EVENT|~/.mpdev/options
OUTPUT_EVENT|~/.mpdev/output
UPDATE_EVENT|~/.mpdev/update
DATABASE_EVENT|~/.mpdev/database
STORED_PLAYLIST_EVENT|~/.mpdev/stored_playlist
PARTITION_EVENT|~/.mpdev/partition
SUBSCRIPTION_EVENT|~/.mpdev/subscription
MESSAGE_EVENT|~/.mpdev/message
MOUNT_EVENT|~/.mpdev/mount
NEIGHBOUR_EVENT|~/.mpdev/neighbour
CUSTOM_EVENT|~/.mpdev/custom

The hooks are passed the following arguments

```
mpd-event   - Passed when the above events listed, apart from SONG_CHANGE happen.
now-playing - Passed when a song starts playing
end-song    - Passed when a song finishes playing
```

The default installation makes a copy of `/usr/libexec/mpdev/player` in `$HOME/.mpdev` for the user with uid `1000`.

The **mpdev** package also comes with `mpdev_update` and `mpdev_cleanup` programs that help in maintaining the sqlite databases `stats.db` and `sticker.db`.

## Environment Variables available to hooks

```
SONG_URI
SONG_LAST_MODIFIED
SONG_ALBUM
SONG_ARTIST
SONG_DATE
SONG_GENRE
SONG_TITLE
SONG_TRACK
SONG_DURATION
SONG_POSITION
SONG_ID
START_TIME
END_TIME
SCROBBLER_LASTFM
SCROBBLER_LIBREFM
VERBOSE
```

If you create the `stats` database, mpdev will update the last\_played field, play\_count fields in stats db. It will also update the song rating that you choose for the song. The ability to rate songs in mpd can be enabled by having the `sticker_file` keyword uncommented in `/etc/mpd.conf`. You will also need a mpd client that uses the mpd sticker command. One such player is `cantata`, which is available for all linux distros and Mac OSX. mpdev can also update [RompR](https://fatg3erman.github.io/RompR/) ratings and play counts and synchronize the ratings between [RompR](https://fatg3erman.github.io/RompR/) MySQL and sticker sqlite databases. Since mpdev runs in the background, it can keep updating [RompR](https://fatg3erman.github.io/RompR/) db and stats db play counts and history without you having to keep [RompR](https://fatg3erman.github.io/RompR/) running.

The sticker database can be enabled by having the followinng entry in `/etc/mpd.conf`

```
#
# The location of the sticker database.  This is a database which
# manages dynamic information attached to songs.
#
sticker_file                    "/var/lib/mpd/sticker.db"
#
```

If you want to use mpdev to update the [RompR](https://fatg3erman.github.io/RompR/) db, you need to set the following variables

```
ROMPR          - set this to any non-empty string (e.g. rompr)
MYSQL_HOST     - set this to the host on which rompr's MySQL database is running
MYSQL_PORT     - Port on which MySQL is running (usually 3306)
MYSQL_USER     - User for connecting to MySQL (e.g. rompr)
MYSQL_PASS     - Password for MYSQL_USER (e.g. romprdbpass)
MYSQL_DATABASE - Database name for rompr db (e.g. romprdb)
```

One can use supervise from the indimail-mta package to run this. The default rpm/debian installation of mpdev will that for you. But it will not enable rompr. To do that you need to run the following commands to create the above environment variables

```
$ sudo /bin/bash
# echo rompr         > /service/mpdev/variables/ROMPR
# echo 192.168.1.100 > /service/mpdev/variables/MYSQL_HOST
# echo 3306          > /service/mpdev/variables/MYSQL_PORT
# echo rompr         > /service/mpdev/variables/MYSQL_USER
# echo romprdbpas    > /service/mpdev/variables/MYSQL_PASS
# echo romprdb       > /service/mpdev/variables/MYSQL_DATABASE
```

To restart the mpdev daemon, you then just need to run the following command

```
$ sudo svc -d /service/mpdev # this stops  the mpdev daemon
$ sudo svc -u /service/mpdev # this starts the mpdev daemon
```

If you want to do a source install and not have the supervise to run mpdev daemon, you could write a simple script and call it in a rc script during boot.

```
#!/bin/sh
while true
do
    env ROMPR=rompr \
        MYSQL_HOST=192.168.1.100
        MYSQL_PORT=3306
        MYSQL_USER=rompr
        MYSQL_PASS=romprdbpass
        MYSQL_DATABASE=romprdb \
    /usr/bin/mpdev -v
done
```

The stats database can be created running the `mpdev_update` program

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS song(
        id              INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        play_count      INTEGER,
        rating          INTEGER,
        uri             TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        duration        INTEGER,
        date_added      INTEGER,
        last_modified   INTEGER,
        artist          TEXT,
        album           TEXT,
        title           TEXT,
        track           TEXT,
        name            TEXT,
        genre           TEXT,
        date            TEXT,
        composer        TEXT,
        performer       TEXT,
        disc            TEXT,
        last_played     INTEGER,
        karma           INTEGER NOT NULL CONSTRAINT karma_percent CHECK (karma >= 0 AND karma <= 100) DEFAULT 50
);

CREATE INDEX rating on song(rating);
CREATE INDEX uri on song(uri);
CREATE INDEX last_played on song(last_played);
CREATE INDEX date_added on song(date_added);
CREATE INDEX last_modified on song(last_modified);
```

The scrobbler modules lastfm-scrobbler, librefm-scrobbler enables scrobbling to last.fm and libre.fm and can be enabled by running lastfm-scrobbler and librefm-scrobbler once as shown below

```
$ lastfm-scrobbler  --connect # for setting up lastfm
$ librefm-scrobbler --connect # for setting up librefm
```

After you have added the connection you should have lastfm-scrobbler.conf file in ~/.config/lastfm-scrobbler and librefm-scrobbler.conf file in ~/.config/librefm-scrobbler. These two files will have your `SESSION_KEY` and `API_KEY`. lastfm-scrobbler and librefm-scrobbler are a copy of moc-scrobbler from https://gitlab.com/pachanka/moc-scrobbler. mpdev will not do scrobbling if the `SESSION_KEY` and `API_KEY` haven't been setup.

By default mpdev will get the host name and port for mpd from MPD\_HOST and MPD\_PORT environment variables. MPD\_PASSWORD environment variable can be set to make mpdev connect to a password-protected mpd. If these environment variables arenâ€™t set, mpdev connects to localhost on port 6600.
